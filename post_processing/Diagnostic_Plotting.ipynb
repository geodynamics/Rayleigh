Output files are numbered by the time step of the final data record stored in the file.  Output behavior for each simulation is controlled through the *main_input* file.   For each output type, the user specifies the output variables, cadence, records-per-file, and other properties by modifying the appropriate variables in the **output_namelist** section of *main_input*.\n",

    "\n",
    "Basic Output Control\n",

    "As an example of how these variables work, suppose that we want to occasionally output equatorial cuts (output type) of temperature, kinetic energy density, and radial velocity (output variables).  At the same time, we might wish to dump full-volume averages (output type) of kinetic and magnetic energy (output variables) with a higher cadence.  In that case, something similar to the following would appear in main_input:\n",

Files are named based on the time step number of their final record.   As a result, information from time steps 50, 100, 150, ..., 4950, 5000 will be stored in the file named *G_Avgs/00005000*.  Time steps 5050 through 10,000 will stored in *G_Avgs/00010000*, and so on.   \n",

Data from time steps 2,500 and 5,000 will be stored in *Equatorial_Slices/00005000*.  Data from time steps 7,500 and 10,000 will be stored in *Equatorial_Slices/00010000* , and so on.\n",

    "Positional Output Control\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of *Rayleigh's* output types allow the user to specify a set of gridpoints at which to sample the simulation.   A user can, for example, output spherical surfaces sampled at arbitrary radii, or a meridional plane sampled at a specific longitude.  This behavior is controlled through additional namelist variables; we refer to these variables as positional specifiers.   In the sections that follow, positional specifiers associated with a given output type, if any, will be defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positional specifiers are either *indicial* or *normalized*.  In the *main_input* file, indicial specifiers can be assigned a comma-separated list of grid indices on which to perform the output.  For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "shellslice_levels = 1, 32, 64, 128\n",
    "\n",
    "instructs *Rayleigh* to output shell slices at { radius[1], radius[32], radius[64], radius[128]}.  Note that radius[1] is the outer boundary.\n",

    "While useful in some situations, specifying indices can lead to confusion if a simulations resolution needs to be changed at some point during a model's evolution.  For example if the radial grid initially had 128 points, index 128 would correspond to the lower boundary.  If the resolution were to double, index 128 would correspond to mid-shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, all positional specifiers may also be written in normalized form.  Instead of integers, the normalized specifier is assigned a comma separated list of real values in the range [0,1].  The value of zero corresponds to the lowest-value grid coordinate (e.g., the inner radial boundary or theta=0 pole).  The value 1 corresponds to the maximal coordinate (e.g., the outer radial boundary or theta=pi pole).   A value of 0.5 corresponds to mid-domain.  Normalized coordinates are indicated by adding *_nrm* to the indicial specifier's name.  For example,\n",

    "\n",
    "instructs *Rayleigh* to output shell slices at the lower boundary, mid-shell, and slightly below the upper boundary.    *Rayleigh* does not interpolate, but instead picks the grid coordinate closest to each specified normalized coordinate.   \n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using normalized coordinates to avoid inconsistencies between restarts.  They also overcome difficulties associated with the non-uniform nature of the radial and theta grids wherein grid points cluster near the boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Positional Ranges**\n",

The diagnostic nature of the Pressure equation in incompressible/anelastic models, coupled with the second-order Crank-Nicolson time-stepping scheme, means that the pressure field can exhibit an even/odd sawtoothing in time.  The *effective* pressure force (as implemented through the Crank-Nicolson scheme) is always a weighted average over two time steps **and is always well-resolved in time**.  \n",

The easiest fix is to output the velocity field and compute its time derivative.  This, in tandem with the sum of all other forces, can be used to calculate the effective pressure as a post-processing step.  The (undesireable)  alternative is to output once every time step and compute the effective pressure using the Crank-Nicolson weighting.    \n",

For any work that uses Rayleigh, or work that uses software which incorporates Rayleigh source code, please acknowledge the authors and funding agencies as: 
Rayleigh has been developed by Nicholas Featherstone with support by the National Science
Foundation through the Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics (CIG).  This
effort was supported by NSF grants NSF-0949446 and NSF-1550901.


A paper describing the parallelization of Rayleigh and the accuracy of its algorithms is now in preparation. For this version
of the code ONLY (version 1.0.x), please cite BOTH of the following references:

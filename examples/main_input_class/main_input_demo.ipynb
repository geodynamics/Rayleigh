    "# The Main_Input Class \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the main_input class.   The main_input class was developed primarily to assist with parameter-space studies, but it may be useful in other situations as well.  We begin with an overview of how to work with main_input objects in python, and then provide an example of how they might be used to help initiate a parameter space study.   Before running this notebook, please copy 'Rayleigh/post_processing/benchmark_diagnostics_input' to the directory from within which you are running this notebook.  Within that directory, you should find a \"jobinfo.txt\" and \"main_input\" file that will be used in the examples below.\n",

    "## Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "To initialize an instance of the main_input class, we must provide a main_input or jobinfo.txt file.   That file will be used to define and initialize the object's internal namelist structure.  An important point to keep in mind is that the namelist structure derives entirely from the main_input file.  Values omitted in the main_input file are not defined for the main_input class.  There are workarounds for this illustrated below.   To begin, let's read in a main_input file (one is provided within the directory that containst his notebook) and view its contents. The most straightforward way to do this is by using Python's print function, which will display all namelist entries that have been assigned a value."

    "## The write and set Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's print function calls the main_input class's *write* method with no optional keywords specified.  For the curious, this is done by defining the  *__repr__* for the main_input class.  By using the write method directly, we can have finer-grained control over the output.  Specifically, we can:\n",

    "1.  Print a single namelist\n",
    "2.  Display nullstring values (e.g., benchmark_mode in the above example) using the verbose optional parameter.\n",

    "4.  Write a new main_input file using the *file* optional parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This functionality is illustrated below, in combination with the set method, which is used to assign new namelist values.  Note that verbose does not impact values written to a new main_input file; nullstring values are ignored.  Examine the contents of *new_main_input* after running the cell below.  Nprow is omitted entirely, and aspect ratio has 2 digits after the decimal.  Anything from the original file is stored as a string, including numerical values, and remains unmodified."

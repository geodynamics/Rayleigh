**init_type**  
  Integer value indicating how nonmagnetic variables should be initialized. 
   * type -1:  Restart from a checkpoint
   * type  1:  Hydro Boussinesq benchmark init (Christensen et al. 2001).  The temperature field is initialized with an :math:`\ell=4` , m=4 perturbation on top of a conductive profile.  Velocity/pressure are zero.
   * type  6:  Hydro anelastic benchmark init (Jones et al. 2011).  The entropy field is initialized with an :math:`\ell=19` , m=19 and :math:`\ell=1` , m=1  perturbation on top of a conductive profile.  Velocity/pressure are zero.
   * type  7:  A randomized temperature/entropy field is initialized.  Velocity and pressure are set to zero.
   * type  8:  Velocity, entropy/temperature, and pressure are initialized to zero, or if an associated filename is provided, they are initialized using the generic input interface.

**magnetic_init_type**
  Integer value indicating how magnetic field should be initialized.
   * type -1:  Initialize magnetic field from a checkpoint.
   * type  1:  Magnetic initialization for  Christensen et al. (2001), case 1.  The poloidal flux function is initialized using an :math:`\ell=1,m=0` mode.  THe toroidal flux function is initialized with an :math:`\ell=2,m=0` mode.  
   * type  7:  The poloidal and toroidal flux functions are initialized to randomized values.  
   * type  8:  The poloidal and toroidal flux functions are intialized to zero, and then if a corresponding generic input file is specified, their initial state is read from that file.
